To build preCICE, simply run `make` in the build directory.
You can also build in parallel using all available logical cores using `make -j $(nproc)`.

As a next step, please [run the tests](installation-source-testing) to ensure everything works as expected.

If you feel lucky, you can skip straight to [installing preCICE](installation-source-installation).
