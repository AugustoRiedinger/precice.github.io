## Python 3

The python bindings for preCICE are [published on PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/pyprecice/) with the package `pyprecice`. You can use your python package manager for installing the language bindings. For example, `pip3 install --user pyprecice`. Note that preCICE and MPI have to be installed on your system.

The python package and detailed documentation for the python bindings can be found [here](https://github.com/precice/python-bindings).
