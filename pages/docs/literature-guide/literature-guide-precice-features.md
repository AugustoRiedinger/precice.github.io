* **Coupling schemes** For an introduction to explicit and implicit coupling, as well as the various acceleration / post-processing techniques, have a look at the dissertations of Bernhard Gatzhammer (Sections 2.3 and 4.1) and Benjamin Uekermann (Chapter 3). 

* **Data mapping** For an introduction to the various techniques, have a look at the dissertations of Bernhard Gatzhammer (Sections 2.4 and 4.2) and Benjamin Uekermann (Section 4.3). For a more condensed overview of RBF mapping, see [Radial Basis Function Interpolation for Black-Box Multi-Physics Simulations](ftp://ftp.informatik.uni-stuttgart.de/pub/library/ncstrl.ustuttgart_fi/INPROC-2017-35/INPROC-2017-35.pdf)

* **Communication** For an introduction to the various techniques, have a look at the dissertation of Bernhard Gatzhammer (Section 4.3). Have a look also at the master's thesis of Alexander Shukaev: "[A Fully Parallel Process-to-Process Intercommunication Technique for preCICE](https://www5.in.tum.de/pub/Shukaev2015_MasterThesis.pdf)".

* **Time interpolation** This feature is currently under active development. Have a look at the publications, talks, and posters of [Benjamin RÃ¼th](https://www5.in.tum.de/wiki/index.php/Benjamin_R%C3%BCth,_M.Sc._(hons)).
