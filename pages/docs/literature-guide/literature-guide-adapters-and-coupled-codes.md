* For the official adapters for open-source solvers, an overview is given in ["Official preCICE Adapters for Standard Open-Source Solvers"](https://www.gacm2017.uni-stuttgart.de/registration/Upload/ExtendedAbstracts/ExtendedAbstract_0138.pdf) (2017).

* For the first implementation of the OpenFOAM, CalculiX, and Code_Aster adapters, have a look at Lucia Cheung Yau's Master's Thesis [Conjugate Heat Transfer with the Multiphysics Coupling Library preCICE](http://www5.in.tum.de/pub/Cheung2016_Thesis.pdf) (2016). Start here also for the physics of Conjugate Heat Transfer. The OpenFOAM adapter was then extended by Gerasimos Chourdakis in his Master's Thesis [A general OpenFOAM adapter for the coupling library preCICE](https://www5.in.tum.de/pub/Chourdakis2017_Thesis.pdf) (2017). Start here for the structure of the current OpenFOAM adapter. For the additional functionality to support mechanical FSI simulations, have a look at [Derek Risseeuw's thesis](http://resolver.tudelft.nl/uuid:70beddde-e870-4c62-9a2f-8758b4e49123).

* For the SU2 adapter, read Alexander Rusch's Bachelor's Thesis [Extending SU2 to Fluid-Structure Interaction via preCICE](http://www5.in.tum.de/pub/Rusch2016_BA.pdf) (2016). In this you can also find a quick introduction to Fluid-Structure Interaction.
