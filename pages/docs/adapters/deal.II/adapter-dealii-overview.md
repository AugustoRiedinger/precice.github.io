#### What is deal.II ?
From their documentation: _deal.II is a C++ program library targeted at the computational solution_
_of partial differential equations using adaptive finite elements. It uses_
_state-of-the-art programming techniques to offer you a modern interface_
_to the complex data structures and algorithms required._ A more extensive answer can be found at the [deal.II webpage](https://www.dealii.org/).


#### Aim of this adapter

This adapter has two use cases: On the one hand, it provides coupled structural solvers, which could be used for FSI simulations steered by preCICE. On the other hand, it serves as an example of how to couple your own deal.II project with other solvers using preCICE. Have a look in the 'build your own adapter' section for more details.
