TODO

Things we need to cover:

## Terminology

* Library approach
* what is difference between preCICE API and available adapters, you have to understand you own code very well (more important than understanding preCICE)
* What is an adapter?
* Peer-to-peer (find better name)
* Black-box approach
* how this section of the docs is structured

Note that _solver_ here refers to the complete simulation code (not the linear algebra solver). With _participant_, we refer to a solver in a coupled simulation.
  
## Application Programming Interface

* In which languages does API exist, links to documentation or bindings
* Minimal reference implementations (solver dummies)
