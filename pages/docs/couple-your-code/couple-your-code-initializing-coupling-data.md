summary: "As default values, preCICE assumes that all coupling variables are zero initially. For fluid-structure interaction, for example, this means that the structure is in its reference state. Sometimes, you want to change this behavior â€“ for instance, you may want to restart your simulation."

{% version 3.0.0 %}
`initializeData()` will be removed in preCICE version 3.0.0. You can do data initialization now by calling `initialize()`.
{% endversion %}

By default preCICE assumes that all coupling variables are zero initially. If you want to provide non-zero initial values, you can write data before calling `initialize()`. This data will then be used as initial data. The preCICE action interface that was introduced in [Step 6](couple-your-code-implicit-coupling) provides the following action to check whether initial data has to be written by a participant:

```cpp
const std::string& constants::actionWriteInitialData()
```

To support data initialization, we extend our example as follows:

```cpp
[...]

const std::string& cowid = precice::constants::actionWriteInitialData();

[...]

int displID = precice.getDataID("Displacements", meshID);
int forceID = precice.getDataID("Forces", meshID);
double* forces = new double[vertexSize*dim];
double* displacements = new double[vertexSize*dim];

[...]

if(precice.isActionRequired(cowid)){
  precice.writeBlockVectorData(forceID, vertexSize, vertexIDs, forces);
  precice.markActionFulfilled(cowid);
}

precice_dt = precice.initialize();

while (precice.isCouplingOngoing()){
  [...]
```

Now, you can specify at runtime if you want to initialize coupling data. For example to initialize displacements:

```xml
[...]
<exchange data="Forces" mesh="StructureMesh" from="FluidSolver" to="SolidSolver" />
<exchange data="Displacements" mesh="StructureMesh" from="SolidSolver" to="FluidSolver" initialize="yes"/>
[...]
```

If you are using a serial coupling scheme, only initial data that is written from the second to the first participant is actually used. Initial data written from the first to the second participant will be ignored, because in a serial coupling scheme the first participant already computes its first result before the second participant even starts.

{% note %}
preCICE still supports data initialization for both participants, even if a serial coupling scheme is used. You can read our section on [time interpolation](couple-your-code-waveform) to learn more about the reasons.
