{% include important.html content="We have not yet ported the documentation of the preCICE tutorials from the preCICE wiki to here. Please go to the [preCICE wiki](https://github.com/precice/precice/wiki#2-getting-started---tutorials)" %}

Tutorials are meant as starting points to build your own coupled simulations. Our collection has grown rapidly over the past few years and we are currently in the process of [restructuring our tutorials](https://github.com/orgs/precice/projects/5) to be clearer, more consistent, and easier to extend. Look for updates at this page in January 2021.

If this is the first time you are trying preCICE, we recommend looking first into our [Quickstart page](quickstart.html). If you want to learn more, you may want to join the [preCICE Workshop 2021](precice-workshop-2021.html)
or [watch a talk on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/preCICECoupling/).
