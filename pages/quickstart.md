* easiest path to get preCICE, meaning Debian package Ubuntu >= 18.04 (and link to Getting preCICE for advanced options)
* run C++ solverdummies (understand basic concept: two terminals, ...)
* easiest path to get OpenFOAM + FEniCS + Python bindings (no links, but copy instructions), flow over heated plate, wget sources 
    * run it, visualize it
    * (alternative could be OpenFOAM + 6dof, then everything would be in C++ and easy to install)
* links to all other things (the preCICE Forum, tutorials, documentation e.g. how to couple your code, testimonials)
