Despite the purely virtual format, the WCCM ECCOMAS 2020 was a great success!

Our minisymposium MS202 "Multiphysics simulations with the coupling library preCICE" was well attended and all-in-all very productive.
Thanks to the WCCM, authors were given access to their recorded talks to be shared with the public.

## The minisymposium


{% include note.html content="If you gave a talk at the minisymposium, please contact us and we will include it in the list!" %}
