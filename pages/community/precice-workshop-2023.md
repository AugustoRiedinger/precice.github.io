The 4th preCICE Workshop will be held in-presence at the campus Garching of the [Technical University of Munich](https://www.tum.de/) ([Leibniz Supercomputing Center](https://www.lrz.de/)), on February 13-16, 2023. The workshop is a coming together of the preCICE community to share ideas, experiences and knowledge about using preCICE, and to learn from others in the process.

Expect user and developer talks, hands-on training sessions, discussions with the developers on your applications and use cases, feedback rounds, and plenty of opportunities to network with the rest of our vibrant community.

## Call for contributions

You do not need to present anything to join this workshop. However, your contributions are very welcome! We are looking for talks that could be beneficial for the wider preCICE community.

### User talks

We have already accepted the following user talks. [Submit your talk](#call-for-contributions). The detailed schedule will be available in late January

<details class="workshop-event" id="talk-shams"><summary>Gym-OpenFOAM: An OpenAI Gym environment for active flow control with deep reinforcement learning</summary>
<p><b>Speaker:</b> Mosayeb Shams<br/>
<b>Affiliation:</b> Heriot Watt University, UK</p>
<p>OpenAI Gym API is a de facto standard API to communicate between reinforcement learning algorithms and simulation environments. The new software Gym-OpenFOAM is a Python environment fully compliant with the OpenAI Gym API to facilitate developing and implementing reinforcement learning algorithms for fluid dynamics applications. In a reinforcement learning-interaction cycle, Gym-OpenFOAM takes advantage of coupling tool preCICE, an open-source library for multi-physics coupling, to handle information exchange between agent (decision maker) and OpenFOAM (simulation environment), an open-source library for computational fluid dynamics. This coupling approach results in a seamless non-invasive integration of a realistic simulation system with the reinforcement learning paradigm, enabling the application of deep reinforcement learning algorithms to the continuum mechanics field.</p>
<p>For the purposes of demonstration, we use Gym-OpenFOAM framework to apply two state-of-the-art reinforcement algorithms, namely proximal policy optimisation (PPO) and soft actor-critic (SAC), for drag attenuation in flow over a cylinder.</p>

<details class="workshop-event" id="talk-fischler"><summary>A preCICE-interface for the ice-sheet and sea-level system model</summary>
<p><b>Speaker:</b> Yannic Fischler<br/>
<b>Affiliation:</b> Technical University of Darmstadt, Germany</p>
<p>Earth system modeling requires expertise of multiple scientific domains, including, for example, geographers, oceanologists and glaciologists. The Ice-sheet and Sea-level system model (ISSM) is a MPI parallel multiphysics finite element framework to simulate large ice-sheets like Greenland and Antarctica. Previous performance studies have validated the good scaling properties of this code.
In climate simulations, ISSM depends on external input data, e.g. subglacial hydrology models. Currently, this data is precalculated and handed to ISSM as a static file input. However, as the subglacial hydrology is affected by ice sheet evolution as well, bidirectional high frequent data exchange is beneficial for the entire accuracy. To enable dynamic data exchange during run-time, we develop the first ever exchange interface for ISSM using preCICE.
We present the coupling of ISSM and CUAS-MPI, a subglacial hydrology model, and discuss the challenges of integrating preCICE in a complex framework like ISSM regarding time stepping and data accessibility. We note that the new possibilities of coupled execution then also create new challenges in modeling, e.g. geometry evolution.</p>

<details class="workshop-event" id="talk-abele"><summary>Coupling an ice sheet model with satellite image based simulation of calving fronts</summary>
<p><b>Speaker:</b> Daniel Abele<br/>
<b>Affiliation:</b> Alfred-Wegener-Institut, Deutsches Zentrum f√ºr Luft- und Raumfahrt, Germany</p>
<p>ISSM (Ice-sheet and Sea-level System Model) is a software to simulate the evolution of glaciers and ice sheets. One of its important features is evolving the front of the glacier, which changes position due to melting, calving, and the forward movement of the glacier itself. Specifically, physics based models of calving are not yet able to capture the real behavior of the system precisely. We want to develop a data driven approach, computing the speed of the front from known positions that have been extracted from satellite images. This code will be coupled with ISSM using preCICE. The project is in its early stages. After a short introduction to ISSM, we will present the numerical methods we will use to compute the frontal speed. The front can be modeled using a level-set equation. Inversion of this model delivers the speed of the front. We will discuss the issues we expect to encounter in coupling the code to ISSM, like adaptive meshes, load balancing, integration of preCICE into ISSM, and stability of the coupled solution. The physics based approaches to calving are deeply integrated into ISSM. We hope to present some preliminary results of stability experiments where ISSM and the moving front module are less tightly coupled.</p>

<details class="workshop-event" id="talk-adhav"><summary>Investigation of OpenFOAM-XDEM momentum coupling results for AWJC Nozzle using preCICE</summary>
<p><b>Speaker:</b> Prasad Adhav<br/>
<b>Affiliation:</b> University of Luxembourg, Luxembourg</p>
<p>The high-speed water jet is the momentum source in an Abrasive Water Jet Cutting Nozzle. This momentum is transferred to the abrasive particles & the air within the nozzle. This leads to turbulent & complex particle-laden flow in the nozzle. These flow conditions can influence particle impacts on the nozzle, thus influencing erosion. Hence it is imperative that this complex particle-laden flow is captured correctly.
The momentum exchange can be directly from the water jet to the particles or indirectly through the airflow. In this work, we investigate these fluid-particle momentum exchanges.
Our prototype uses preCICE for volumetric coupling of XDEM (for the particle motion), & OpenFOAM (for the fluid). XDEM uses fluid flow conditions to compute the forces acting on particles. XDEM computes the particle momentum source that is injected into the fluid solver. The results of the coupled simulation align with literature & can be extended to include the FEM component for erosion predictions.</p>

More talks following (after January 16).

### Developer talks

<details class="workshop-event" id="talk-rodenberg"><summary>B-Splines for flexible and robust multirate time stepping</summary>
<p><b>Speaker:</b> Benjamin Rodenberg<br/>
<b>Affiliation:</b> Technical University of Munich, Germany</p>
<p>Black-box coupling schemes often only reach first order when it comes to time stepping. Most coupling schemes do not allow the coupled solvers to run at independent time scales (multirate). In this talk, I will explain how we use B-Splines to construct a higher-order interpolating function for each coupling time window in preCICE. This approach allows multirate and higher-order time stepping for coupled black-box solvers. Additionally, I introduce the API, demonstrate possible use cases, and investigate the performance of this new feature through the example of a simple oscillator test case.</p>

More talks following (after January 16).

### World Caf√©

A classic for a preCICE Workshop, the preCICE [World Caf√©](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_caf%C3%A9_(conversation)) is your opportunity to shape the future of preCICE.

### User support sessions

It's a workshop and not a classical conference, as we also get to do things together. Meet the experts to discuss your current or planned projects, as well as to debug any current issues.

On March 31, 10:00-15:00, we will have a post-workshop user-support session to catch up on any progress.

### preCICE training course

If you are new to preCICE, this is the perfect way to get started. February 13 is for you, offering only training (parts I-III). Even if you joined this course in previous years, don't miss the new part IV on February 16.
