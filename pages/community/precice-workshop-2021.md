The 2nd preCICE Workshop will be held virtually through the [University of Stuttgart](https://www.uni-stuttgart.de/en/), from February 22-25, 2021. The workshop is a coming together of the preCICE community to share ideas, experiences and knowledge about using preCICE, and to learn from others in the process. [Registration](https://www.precice.org/precice-workshop-2021.html#registration) for the workshop is still open. 

If you have any questions regarding the workshop, please contact us at precice2021@ipvs.uni-stuttgart.de.

* The developer talks consist of various topics relating to the internals of preCICE. The following topics will be presented in the developer talks:
* Session I:
  * Two-level Initialization
  * Data-Mapping in preCICE
  * Macro-Micro Coupling

<details class="workshop-event" id="Jaust"><summary>Alexander Jaust: Solving coupled free and porous‐media flow with preCICE and DuMuX</summary>
<p>Authors: <a href="https://www.ipvs.uni-stuttgart.de/institute/team/Jaust-00001/">Alexander Jaust</a>, Miriam Mehl<br/>
Affiliation: University of Stuttgart</p>
<p>We present recent results of coupling free and porous‐media flow applications and the development of the corresponding adapter. The main focus is on simulations based on DuMuX (https://dumux.org/) which is an open‐source framework for solving flow problems, especially porous‐media flow. We present results using the partitioned approach of preCICE for different scenarios and compare it, where applicable, with monolithic simulations or exact solutions.</p>

* The World Cafe styled feedback session will consist of various breakout rooms. Participants will be free to discuss the pros/cons of the virtual workshop.

## Registration

This is an academic, non-profit conference. However, we still have to collect a small registration fee. 

For early registrations (until January 17), the registration fee is 50€. Registration is still possible after this date, with a registration fee of 100€.

Please use the [registration form](https://tagung.informatik-forum.org/preCICE2021/register) to register.

For those that do not have access to funding to pay for the registration, you can write an email to us at precice2021@ipvs.uni-stuttgart.de, and we will evaluate each case individually. For selected cases we will supply a voucher to be used when registering that voids the required payment.
