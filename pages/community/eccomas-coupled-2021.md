The [ECCOMAS COUPLED 2021](https://congress.cimne.com/coupled2021/frontal/default.asp)
([archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20201027054315/https://congress.cimne.com/coupled2021/frontal/InvitedSessions.asp))
was originally scheduled for summer 2021 in Chia Laguna, South Sardinia, Italy but was changed to a virtual format.
Continuing the tradition, we are organizing an invited session [Multi-physics simulations with the coupling library preCICE](https://congress.cimne.com/coupled2021/frontal/doc/IS/MultiPhysicsSimulationsWithCouplingLibraryPreCICE.pdf).

## The invited session

You can submit your abstract [until March 15, 2021](https://congress.cimne.com/coupled2021/frontal/Dates.asp).

We will update this page with more details in April. Follow the discussion on [the forum](https://precice.discourse.group/t/precice-invited-session-at-eccomas-coupled-2021/448).

## Further talks about preCICE

Large conferences like this are an ideal opportunity to discuss with other groups and change our perspective. For this reason, we often participate with talks in different sessions.

Stay tuned for more details.
